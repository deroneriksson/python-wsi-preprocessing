# Python WSI Preprocessing

This project contains a variety of files for investigating image preprocessing using Python
with the aim of using deep learning to perform histopathology image classification of
whole slide images.

See main tutorial [here](./docs/wsi-preprocessing-in-python/index.md).

See main project at [https://github.com/CODAIT/deep-histopath](https://github.com/CODAIT/deep-histopath)
for more information.
